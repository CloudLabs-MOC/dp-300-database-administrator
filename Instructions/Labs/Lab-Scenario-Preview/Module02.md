# Lab Scenario Preview: Lab02: Provision an Azure SQL Database

## Lab overview

Students will configure basic resources needed to deploy an Azure SQL Database with a Virtual Network Endpoint. Connectivity to the SQL Database will be validated using Azure Data Studio from the lab VM.

As a database administrator for AdventureWorks, you will set up a new SQL Database, including a Virtual Network Endpoint to increase and simplify the security of the deployment. Azure Data Studio will be used to evaluate the use of a SQL Notebook for data querying and results retention.

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Create a Virtual Network
- Provision an Azure SQL Database
- Enable access to an Azure SQL Database
- Connect to an Azure SQL Database in Azure Data Studio
