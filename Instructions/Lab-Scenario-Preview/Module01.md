# Lab Scenario Preview: Lab01: Provision a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine 

## Lab overview

Students will explore the Azure Portal and use it to create an Azure VM with SQL Server 2019 installed. Then they will connect to the virtual machine through Remote Desktop Protocol.

You are a database administrator for AdventureWorks. You need to create a test environment for use in a proof of concept. The proof of concept will use SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine and a backup of the AdventureWorksDW database. You need to set up the Virtual Machine, restore the database, and query it to ensure it is available.

## Objectives
